Interviewing sucks! The process is time consuming, drains a lot of our energy and most of the time in return it gives us mental stress. But, you gotta do what you gotta do! 

In order to make this process less stressful and more enjoyable, I want to put out here few points that have worked well for me. 

### Interview with a Purpose:

Even before you start applying for jobs, think: 

* What kind of work are you looking for in the next role ?
* What do you like working on the most? 
* What do you care about the most - for ex : salary, engineering culture, open source projects, free food üçï

Many times we just want the job. But its important in long term to be intentional about what kind of job do you want. Also, it will be easier to rule out the companies where you don't want to work. 

### The Resume:

Resume is your first selling point. Make it short, concise but impactful. As a rule of thumb you want to have a single page resume which includes following sections: 

* Contact info
* Work Experience 
* Achievements 
* Technical Skills
* Education

Check out my resume for example [here](https://github.com/akshar07/Resume/blob/master/AksharTakle-%20Resume%20%20copy.pdf). 

### People having zero experience / new grads:

Everyone started somewhere with zero experience. They worked their way up. Do not get bogged down by the fact that you don't have any experience. Instead, show off your skills more aggressively. Build projects - any project. Doesn't matter which as long as you can take out some learning points. Write blogs about it. Tweet about it. Get into the limelight. If you are a new grad or someone with zero experience doing side projects will help you the best. Have knowledge about different things. It does not have to be very deep. **Show that you are curious** in the interviews that you go to.

That being said, **following are the things that you must know** before going for any frontend interview: 

* Basic Javascript Concepts - event handling, bubbling, block vs functional scoping, promises and basic css. Its okay if you don't know the css frameworks like css grid or flex box. No one remembers that shit anyways. Everyone googles it.
* Decent understanding of your choice of frontend framework. For ex: React - know how to compose components, pass down props, which lifecycle method is suitable for particular scenario, bonus - performance optimizations. Know the industry best practices. (Check out repos on github to know what they are). You have access to everything. 

### For experienced people:

Companies will have more expectations from you. You are not allowed to screw up the basic javascript, and css parts.  You have to be good at writing code, composing components and best practices should follow by default. Front end dev and node are closely tied together. So be ready to answer conceptual node questions. Here are few things that you should know: 

* Node workflow 
* Server side rendering
* Redux / Complex state management 
* GraphQL
* Performance Optimizations 
* Native browser / DOM operations (like history, browser events, requestAnimationFrame etc.)

### The Interview Process :

Most of the companies will follow a standard process which consists of: 

* Initial Recruiter Call
* Phone screen
* More phone screen / code test / hacker rank test
* On site Interview 

After at least a couple of tries at this, if you are still alive, Congrats! You are ready to crack your next interview. 

***Alright!*** Lets break down the interview process and see how to climb up each step. 

#### *Initial Recruiter Call :*

This step is to gauge your overall interest and see if you can be fit for the position at a very high level. get this done quickly, without thinking about it much. How? Be ready to answer questions on these lines: 

* What are you upto currently ?
* What are you looking in your next role? 
* Why are you switching (if switching)? 
* What are you currently working on? What projects have you worked on ?
* What interests you in our company? 
* Whats your availability for next rounds

Prepare for these questions and you should be fine. For questions like why do you want to work for this company, you will have to do some research. Take out 5 mins before interview, visit company's website, understand what they do and what are their projects. 

You don't want to spend too much time preparing for this round. So PRACTICE and make it smooth. 

#### ***Phone Screen:***

Here, you will probably speak with the hiring manager or some engineer from the hiring team. This round could have online coding exercise or just oral one to one questions and can go from 30 mins to 1 hr. Ask whats the structure of the interview beforehand so you can be prepared.

During the interview, ask questions, lots of them. Understand clearly what the problem is. After that, come up with a solution and walk through it. Again, ask. Ask if they think it is the right way. If not they will guide you to the right direction sometimes subtly or sometimes directly. Listen carefully for the clues. This also a chance to know your could be co workers. You can come to if they are easy going, serious, rude or whatever they might be. 

In the exercise if you are given some task that is frontend work, show your coding skills, follow best practices, get some optimizations, handle edge cases. If you are a new grad or someone with no experience, your side projects will help you as lot in this round. If its algorithm exercise, then hopefully you have already solved enough leetcode problems to make it through this round. 

**If you are a new grad or just starting, make sure you know how to tackle string, array manipulations and recursion** 

#### ***Code Test / Hacker Rank :***

many companies will have this round where you will either do a take home test or do live pair programming.  The test can be
